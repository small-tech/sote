# Send Output To Editor (sote)

_Pronounced saut√©, get it? (Sorry.)_

Sends the output of the last command to your default editor.

If that‚Äôs something like [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com), you can use multiple cursors, etc., to manipulate it and copy it into the system clipboard (<kbd>space</kbd><kbd>y</kbd> in Helix) to use in future commands.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Sote re-runs the last command in order to get the output __so don‚Äôt use it after a command that has side-effects__.

üí° Terminals/shells [could provide much better support for this use case](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2644). Given how obsessed some folks are about never touching the mouse, I‚Äôm quite suprised it hasn‚Äôt happened yet.

## Install

Install using [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```shell
fisher install small-tech/sote
```

## Use

You can use the `sote` command or, even better, bind it to a keyboard shortcut. For example, to bind it to <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>s</kbd>, add the following to your fish configuration (likely _~/.config/fish/config.fish_):

```fish
bind \cs sote
```

## How it works

Technically, like basically everything else in Fish shell, [it‚Äôs just a function](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2016/01/16/fishy-functions/).

It gets your last history item (`$history[1]`), re-runs it using `eval()`, then splits the output into multiple lines and sends it to your `$EDITOR`.

## Related tools and workflows

  - Instead of getting a directory listing (e.g., `ls -1`) and manipulating the results with Sote, you could use a file manager like [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) that lets you make [multiple selections](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gokcehan/lf#section-readme) (in lf, by pressing <kbd>space</kbd>).

  - Specifically for renaming multiple files, see [mmv](https://github.com/itchyny/mmv).
